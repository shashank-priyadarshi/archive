## Introduction and Recap

Welcome to Day 6 of our Temporal training. Over the past five days, we've built a comprehensive understanding of Temporal's core components:

- **Day 1:** We explored the historical context and fundamental architecture
- **Day 2:** We delved into workflows and the critical concept of determinism
- **Day 3:** We mastered activities, retries, and idempotency
- **Day 4:** We learned about task queues and worker management
- **Day 5:** We explored signals and queries for workflow interaction

Today, we focus on **time-based operations** in Temporal workflows. Time is a fundamental aspect of business processesâ€”approvals need deadlines, payments have processing windows, and notifications require delays. Understanding how to handle time correctly in Temporal is crucial for building robust, production-ready workflows.

**Today's Learning Objectives:**
- Differentiate between durable timers and standard time.sleep()
- Master Workflow.sleep() for delays and reminders
- Implement strategies for waiting on external conditions
- Combine signals and timers for human-in-the-loop workflows
- Understand advanced timer patterns and best practices

## Understanding Durable Timers vs. Standard Sleep

### The Problem with Standard Sleep

In traditional programming, when you need to pause execution, you might use:

```python
import time
import asyncio

# Synchronous sleep - BLOCKS the entire thread
time.sleep(10)

# Asynchronous sleep - still not durable
await asyncio.sleep(10)
```

**Why these don't work in Temporal workflows:**

1. **Non-Deterministic:** The actual sleep duration depends on system load, scheduling, and other factors
2. **Non-Durable:** If the worker crashes during sleep, the sleep state is lost
3. **Resource Waste:** The worker thread is blocked, preventing it from processing other tasks
4. **No Persistence:** The sleep state isn't recorded in the workflow history

### Temporal's Durable Sleep

Temporal provides `workflow.sleep()` as a durable, deterministic alternative:

```python
from datetime import timedelta
from temporalio import workflow

@workflow.defn
class TimerWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, delay_seconds: int) -> str:
        workflow.logger.info(f"Starting workflow, will sleep for {delay_seconds} seconds")

        # Durable sleep - persists across worker restarts
        await workflow.sleep(delay_seconds)

        workflow.logger.info("Sleep completed, continuing workflow")
        return "Workflow completed after sleep"
```

**How Workflow.sleep() Works:**

1. **Command Generation:** When you call `workflow.sleep(duration)`, the Temporal SDK generates a `StartTimer` command
2. **History Recording:** This command is recorded in the workflow's event history as a `TimerStarted` event
3. **Server-Side Timer:** The Temporal server creates a timer that will fire after the specified duration
4. **Workflow Suspension:** The workflow execution is suspended, and the worker can process other tasks
5. **Timer Firing:** When the timer expires, the server generates a `TimerFired` event
6. **Workflow Resumption:** The workflow is scheduled to resume, and execution continues from where it left off

**Key Benefits:**
- **Durable:** Timer state persists across worker crashes and restarts
- **Deterministic:** The timer duration is exactly what you specify
- **Efficient:** Workers aren't blocked during sleep
- **Auditable:** All timer events are recorded in the workflow history

## Effective Use of Workflow.sleep()

### Basic Timer Usage

```python
from datetime import timedelta
from temporalio import workflow

@workflow.defn
class ReminderWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, user_id: str, reminder_delay: int) -> str:
        workflow.logger.info(f"Setting up reminder for user {user_id}")

        # Wait for the specified delay
        await workflow.sleep(reminder_delay)

        # Send the reminder (via activity)
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            send_reminder_activity,
            user_id,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
        )

        return f"Reminder sent to user {user_id}"
```

### Timer with Dynamic Duration

```python
@workflow.defn
class AdaptiveDelayWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, base_delay: int, retry_count: int = 0) -> str:
        # Calculate delay with exponential backoff
        delay = base_delay * (2 ** retry_count)

        workflow.logger.info(f"Waiting {delay} seconds before retry {retry_count}")
        await workflow.sleep(delay)

        # Attempt the operation
        try:
            result = await workflow.execute_activity(
                risky_operation_activity,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=60)
            )
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            if retry_count < 3:
                # Recursive retry with increased delay
                return await self.run(base_delay, retry_count + 1)
            else:
                raise e
```

### Multiple Timers in Sequence

```python
@workflow.defn
class MultiStageWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> str:
        workflow.logger.info("Starting multi-stage workflow")

        # Stage 1: Initial processing
        await workflow.execute_activity(initial_processing_activity)

        # Wait 5 minutes before stage 2
        await workflow.sleep(300)

        # Stage 2: Secondary processing
        await workflow.execute_activity(secondary_processing_activity)

        # Wait 10 minutes before final stage
        await workflow.sleep(600)

        # Stage 3: Final processing
        result = await workflow.execute_activity(final_processing_activity)

        return result
```

### Timer with Cancellation

```python
@workflow.defn
class CancellableTimerWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.timer_cancelled = False

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, timeout_seconds: int) -> str:
        # Start a timer for the timeout
        timer_handle = workflow.start_timer(timeout_seconds)

        # Wait for either the timer to fire or a cancellation signal
        await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.timer_cancelled)

        if self.timer_cancelled:
            timer_handle.cancel()
            return "Timer was cancelled"
        else:
            return "Timer completed"

    @workflow.signal
    async def cancel_timer(self):
        self.timer_cancelled = True
```

## Strategies for External Waits

### Waiting for External Conditions

Sometimes you need to wait for external conditions that aren't time-based. Temporal provides several patterns for this:

#### Pattern 1: Polling with Timers

```python
@workflow.defn
class PollingWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, resource_id: str, max_wait_seconds: int) -> str:
        start_time = workflow.now()

        while True:
            # Check if the external condition is met
            status = await workflow.execute_activity(
                check_resource_status_activity,
                resource_id,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
            )

            if status == "ready":
                return f"Resource {resource_id} is ready"

            # Check if we've exceeded the maximum wait time
            elapsed = (workflow.now() - start_time).total_seconds()
            if elapsed > max_wait_seconds:
                raise Exception(f"Timeout waiting for resource {resource_id}")

            # Wait before the next poll
            await workflow.sleep(60)  # Poll every minute
```

#### Pattern 2: Signal-Based Waiting

```python
@workflow.defn
class SignalWaitWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.external_event_received = False
        self.event_data = None

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, timeout_seconds: int) -> str:
        # Wait for external signal or timeout
        await workflow.wait_condition(
            lambda: self.external_event_received,
            timeout=timeout_seconds
        )

        if self.external_event_received:
            return f"Received external event: {self.event_data}"
        else:
            return "Timeout waiting for external event"

    @workflow.signal
    async def external_event(self, data: str):
        self.external_event_received = True
        self.event_data = data
```

#### Pattern 3: Hybrid Approach

```python
@workflow.defn
class HybridWaitWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.condition_met = False
        self.last_check_time = None

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, max_wait_seconds: int) -> str:
        start_time = workflow.now()

        while not self.condition_met:
            # Check if timeout exceeded
            elapsed = (workflow.now() - start_time).total_seconds()
            if elapsed > max_wait_seconds:
                raise Exception("Timeout waiting for condition")

            # Wait for either a signal or a timer
            await workflow.wait_condition(
                lambda: self.condition_met,
                timeout=300  # Check every 5 minutes
            )

            # If no signal received, check the condition manually
            if not self.condition_met:
                self.condition_met = await workflow.execute_activity(
                    check_external_condition_activity
                )

        return "Condition met successfully"

    @workflow.signal
    async def condition_signal(self):
        self.condition_met = True
```

## Combining Signals and Timers

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflows

One of the most powerful patterns in Temporal is combining signals and timers for human-in-the-loop workflows:

```python
@workflow.defn
class ApprovalWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.approval_received = False
        self.approval_decision = None
        self.escalation_sent = False

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, request_id: str, approver_id: str) -> str:
        workflow.logger.info(f"Starting approval workflow for request {request_id}")

        # Send initial approval request
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            send_approval_request_activity,
            request_id,
            approver_id,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
        )

        # Wait for approval or timeout (24 hours)
        approval_timeout = 24 * 60 * 60  # 24 hours in seconds

        try:
            await workflow.wait_condition(
                lambda: self.approval_received,
                timeout=approval_timeout
            )

            if self.approval_decision == "approved":
                return await self.process_approval(request_id)
            else:
                return await self.process_rejection(request_id)

        except TimeoutError:
            # Handle timeout - escalate to manager
            return await self.handle_timeout(request_id, approver_id)

    @workflow.signal
    async def approve(self, decision: str, comments: str = ""):
        self.approval_received = True
        self.approval_decision = decision

        workflow.logger.info(f"Approval decision received: {decision}")

    async def handle_timeout(self, request_id: str, approver_id: str) -> str:
        if not self.escalation_sent:
            # Send escalation notification
            await workflow.execute_activity(
                escalate_approval_activity,
                request_id,
                approver_id,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
            )
            self.escalation_sent = True

            # Wait additional time for escalation response
            await workflow.sleep(4 * 60 * 60)  # 4 more hours

            # Auto-approve if still no response
            return await self.process_approval(request_id)

        return "Request auto-approved due to timeout"

    async def process_approval(self, request_id: str) -> str:
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            process_approved_request_activity,
            request_id,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=60)
        )
        return f"Request {request_id} approved and processed"

    async def process_rejection(self, request_id: str) -> str:
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            process_rejected_request_activity,
            request_id,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
        )
        return f"Request {request_id} rejected"
```

### Advanced Signal-Timer Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Graceful Degradation

```python
@workflow.defn
class GracefulDegradationWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.primary_response = None
        self.fallback_triggered = False

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, request_id: str) -> str:
        # Try primary service with short timeout
        try:
            self.primary_response = await workflow.execute_activity(
                call_primary_service_activity,
                request_id,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10)
            )
            return self.primary_response
        except Exception:
            workflow.logger.warning("Primary service failed, using fallback")

        # Wait for manual override or use fallback
        try:
            await workflow.wait_condition(
                lambda: self.primary_response is not None,
                timeout=300  # 5 minutes
            )
            return self.primary_response
        except TimeoutError:
            # Use fallback service
            return await workflow.execute_activity(
                call_fallback_service_activity,
                request_id,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
            )

    @workflow.signal
    async def manual_override(self, response: str):
        self.primary_response = response
```

#### Pattern 2: Batch Processing with Timeout

```python
@workflow.defn
class BatchProcessingWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.batch_items = []
        self.processing_complete = False
        self.batch_size = 10
        self.max_wait_time = 3600  # 1 hour

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, initial_items: list) -> str:
        self.batch_items.extend(initial_items)
        start_time = workflow.now()

        while not self.processing_complete:
            # Check if we have enough items or timeout reached
            elapsed = (workflow.now() - start_time).total_seconds()

            if len(self.batch_items) >= self.batch_size or elapsed >= self.max_wait_time:
                # Process the batch
                result = await workflow.execute_activity(
                    process_batch_activity,
                    self.batch_items,
                    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=300)
                )
                self.processing_complete = True
                return result
            else:
                # Wait for more items or timeout
                remaining_time = self.max_wait_time - elapsed
                await workflow.wait_condition(
                    lambda: len(self.batch_items) >= self.batch_size,
                    timeout=min(remaining_time, 300)  # Check every 5 minutes
                )

        return "Batch processing completed"

    @workflow.signal
    async def add_item(self, item: str):
        self.batch_items.append(item)
        workflow.logger.info(f"Added item to batch. Current size: {len(self.batch_items)}")
```

## Advanced Timer Patterns

### Timer with Retry Logic

```python
@workflow.defn
class RetryTimerWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, max_retries: int = 3) -> str:
        retry_count = 0

        while retry_count <= max_retries:
            try:
                # Attempt the operation
                result = await workflow.execute_activity(
                    risky_operation_activity,
                    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=60)
                )
                return result

            except Exception as e:
                retry_count += 1
                if retry_count > max_retries:
                    raise e

                # Exponential backoff with jitter
                base_delay = 60 * (2 ** (retry_count - 1))  # 60s, 120s, 240s
                jitter = random.randint(0, 30)  # Add 0-30s jitter
                delay = base_delay + jitter

                workflow.logger.info(f"Retry {retry_count} failed, waiting {delay}s")
                await workflow.sleep(delay)

        raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

### Timer with Conditional Logic

```python
@workflow.defn
class ConditionalTimerWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.condition_met = False
        self.timer_active = True

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, check_interval: int = 300) -> str:
        while self.timer_active:
            # Check the condition
            self.condition_met = await workflow.execute_activity(
                check_condition_activity,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
            )

            if self.condition_met:
                self.timer_active = False
                return "Condition met, workflow completed"

            # Wait before next check
            await workflow.sleep(check_interval)

        return "Workflow completed"

    @workflow.signal
    async def stop_timer(self):
        self.timer_active = False
```

### Timer with Dynamic Intervals

```python
@workflow.defn
class AdaptiveTimerWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_interval = 60  # Start with 1 minute
        self.max_interval = 3600    # Max 1 hour
        self.min_interval = 10      # Min 10 seconds

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> str:
        while True:
            # Perform the periodic task
            result = await workflow.execute_activity(
                periodic_task_activity,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
            )

            # Adjust interval based on result
            if result.get("high_priority"):
                self.current_interval = max(self.min_interval, self.current_interval // 2)
            elif result.get("low_priority"):
                self.current_interval = min(self.max_interval, self.current_interval * 2)

            workflow.logger.info(f"Next check in {self.current_interval} seconds")
            await workflow.sleep(self.current_interval)
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Payment Processing with Timeout

```python
@workflow.defn
class PaymentProcessingWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.payment_confirmed = False
        self.payment_failed = False

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, payment_id: str, amount: float) -> str:
        workflow.logger.info(f"Processing payment {payment_id} for ${amount}")

        # Initiate payment
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            initiate_payment_activity,
            payment_id,
            amount,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
        )

        # Wait for confirmation or timeout (30 minutes)
        try:
            await workflow.wait_condition(
                lambda: self.payment_confirmed or self.payment_failed,
                timeout=1800  # 30 minutes

### Example 2: Order Fulfillment with SLA Monitoring

```python
@workflow.defn
class OrderFulfillmentWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.order_status = "processing"
        self.sla_breached = False

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, order_id: str) -> str:
        workflow.logger.info(f"Starting fulfillment for order {order_id}")

        # Start SLA monitoring timer (24 hours)
        sla_timer = workflow.start_timer(24 * 60 * 60)

        try:
            # Process order
            await workflow.execute_activity(
                process_order_activity,
                order_id,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=300)
            )

            # Wait for inventory confirmation
            await workflow.wait_condition(
                lambda: self.order_status == "inventory_confirmed",
                timeout=3600  # 1 hour
            )

            # Ship order
            await workflow.execute_activity(
                ship_order_activity,
                order_id,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=180)
            )

            # Cancel SLA timer since we completed on time
            sla_timer.cancel()

            return f"Order {order_id} fulfilled successfully"

        except Exception as e:
            # Check if SLA was breached
            if not sla_timer.is_cancelled():
                self.sla_breached = True
                await workflow.execute_activity(
                    handle_sla_breach_activity,
                    order_id,
                    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
                )

            raise e

    @workflow.signal
    async def inventory_confirmed(self):
        self.order_status = "inventory_confirmed"

    @workflow.query
    def get_status(self) -> dict:
        return {
            "order_status": self.order_status,
            "sla_breached": self.sla_breached
        }
```

## Best Practices and Anti-Patterns

### Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Timeouts:**
   ```python
   # Good: Reasonable timeout for external API calls
   await workflow.execute_activity(
       call_external_api_activity,
       start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
   )

   # Good: Longer timeout for batch processing
   await workflow.execute_activity(
       process_large_dataset_activity,
       start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(hours=2)
   )
   ```

2. **Combine Timers with Signals:**
   ```python
   # Good: Wait for signal with timeout fallback
   try:
       await workflow.wait_condition(
           lambda: self.condition_met,
           timeout=3600  # 1 hour timeout
       )
   except TimeoutError:
       # Handle timeout gracefully
       await self.handle_timeout()
   ```

3. **Use Exponential Backoff:**
   ```python
   # Good: Exponential backoff for retries
   base_delay = 60 * (2 ** retry_count)
   await workflow.sleep(base_delay)
   ```

4. **Cancel Timers When No Longer Needed:**
   ```python
   # Good: Cancel timer when condition is met
   timer_handle = workflow.start_timer(3600)
   try:
       await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.condition_met)
       timer_handle.cancel()  # Cancel if condition met early
   except TimeoutError:
       # Timer fired, handle timeout
       pass
   ```

### Anti-Patterns

1. **Avoid Infinite Loops:**
   ```python
   # Bad: Infinite loop without timeout
   while True:
       await workflow.sleep(60)
       # This will run forever

   # Good: Loop with exit condition
   while not self.completed:
       await workflow.sleep(60)
       self.completed = await self.check_condition()
   ```

2. **Don't Use Standard Sleep:**
   ```python
   # Bad: Using standard sleep
   import time
   time.sleep(10)  # This will break determinism

   # Good: Using workflow.sleep
   await workflow.sleep(10)
   ```

3. **Avoid Very Short Timers:**
   ```python
   # Bad: Very short timer (less than 1 second)
   await workflow.sleep(0.1)  # This can cause performance issues

   # Good: Reasonable timer duration
   await workflow.sleep(1)  # Minimum 1 second
   ```

4. **Don't Ignore Timer Cancellation:**
   ```python
   # Bad: Not checking if timer was cancelled
   timer_handle = workflow.start_timer(3600)
   await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.condition_met)
   # Timer might still be running

   # Good: Cancel timer when no longer needed
   timer_handle = workflow.start_timer(3600)
   await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.condition_met)
   timer_handle.cancel()  # Cancel the timer
   ```

## Performance Considerations

### Timer Overhead

- **Server-Side Timers:** Timers are managed by the Temporal server, not workers
- **Memory Usage:** Each timer consumes a small amount of server memory
- **Scalability:** Temporal can handle millions of concurrent timers efficiently

### Best Practices for Performance

1. **Batch Timer Operations:**
   ```python
   # Good: Batch multiple operations
   await workflow.sleep(300)  # 5 minutes
   results = await asyncio.gather(*[
       workflow.execute_activity(activity_1),
       workflow.execute_activity(activity_2),
       workflow.execute_activity(activity_3)
   ])
   ```

2. **Use Appropriate Timer Granularity:**
   ```python
   # Good: Use reasonable intervals
   await workflow.sleep(60)  # 1 minute intervals

   # Avoid: Too frequent checks
   await workflow.sleep(1)  # 1 second intervals
   ```

3. **Limit Concurrent Timers:**
   ```python
   # Good: Limit number of active timers
   max_concurrent_timers = 10
   active_timers = []

   for i in range(max_concurrent_timers):
       timer_handle = workflow.start_timer(3600)
       active_timers.append(timer_handle)
   ```

## Troubleshooting Timer Issues

### Common Timer Problems

1. **Timer Not Firing:**
   - Check if the workflow is still running
   - Verify the timer duration is reasonable
   - Check Temporal server logs for errors

2. **Timer Firing Too Early:**
   - Ensure you're using `workflow.sleep()` not standard sleep
   - Check for workflow replay issues
   - Verify timer duration calculation

3. **Timer Cancellation Issues:**
   - Ensure timer handle is accessible
   - Check if timer was already cancelled
   - Verify cancellation timing

### Debugging Techniques

```python
@workflow.defn
class DebugTimerWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, delay_seconds: int) -> str:
        start_time = workflow.now()
        workflow.logger.info(f"Starting timer for {delay_seconds} seconds")

        await workflow.sleep(delay_seconds)

        end_time = workflow.now()
        actual_delay = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds()

        workflow.logger.info(f"Timer completed. Expected: {delay_seconds}s, Actual: {actual_delay}s")

        return f"Timer completed after {actual_delay} seconds"
```

### Monitoring Timer Performance

```python
@workflow.defn
class MonitoredTimerWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> dict:
        timer_metrics = {
            "start_time": workflow.now(),
            "timer_durations": [],
            "total_timers": 0
        }

        for i in range(5):
            timer_start = workflow.now()
            await workflow.sleep(60)  # 1 minute
            timer_end = workflow.now()

            duration = (timer_end - timer_start).total_seconds()
            timer_metrics["timer_durations"].append(duration)
            timer_metrics["total_timers"] += 1

        timer_metrics["end_time"] = workflow.now()
        timer_metrics["average_duration"] = sum(timer_metrics["timer_durations"]) / len(timer_metrics["timer_durations"])

        return timer_metrics
```
